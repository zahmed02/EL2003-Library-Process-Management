# Library Management System

## Overview
This project is a Library Management System developed in Assembly Language using the Irvine32 library. The system is designed to manage library operations such as adding, removing, and searching for books, as well as managing user accounts.

## Features
- **Add Books**: Allows users to add new books to the library database.
- **Remove Books**: Enables users to remove books from the library.
- **Search Books**: Users can search for books by title or author.
- **User  Management**: Manage user accounts for library access.

## Requirements
- **Assembly Language**: Knowledge of assembly language programming.
- **Irvine32 Library**: Ensure that the Irvine32 library is included in your project.
- **Assembler**: Use an assembler compatible with Irvine32 (e.g., MASM).

## Compilation and Execution
**To compile and run the project, follow these steps:
**1. Open your assembly language IDE (e.g., Visual Studio, MASM).
**2. Load the `Main.asm` file.
**3. Ensure that the Irvine32 library is correctly linked.
**4. Assemble the project and resolve any errors.
**5. Run the executable to start the Library Management System.

6. ## Limitations
- **The current implementation may have limitations in terms of the number of books and users it can handle, depending on the data structures used.
- **The user interface is text-based and may not be as user-friendly as graphical interfaces.
